# Working with stringr


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

String manipulations comes in handy in the data wrangling process and when scraping data from the web. stringr is a grammar of string manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common string manipulation challenges.
