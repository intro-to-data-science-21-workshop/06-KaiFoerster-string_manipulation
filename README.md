# Working with stringr


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the string manipulation package in R called stringr. String manipulations comes in handy in the data wrangling process, when scraping data from the web or trying to conduct NLP. stringr is a grammar of string manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common string manipulation challenges in daily life. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about the stringr package and why string manipulation is more important than you think, (2) familiarise you with the most frequently used verbs of the package, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings (see below).
